# MSc-Szekeres
Fortran and Python code developed for my MSc degree, simulating the CMB and the COMPOSITE catalogue in Szekeres models. This repository contains only the code used to simulate the BNW model. The BNW model is the Axisymmetric Szekeres model used by Bolejko, Nazer, and Wiltshire in their 2016 paper *Differential cosmic expansion and the Hubble flow anisotropy*, published in JCAP ([Krzysztof Bolejko *et al* JCAP06(2016)035](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2016/06/035/meta)).

The thesis contains an investigation of an alternative model. The code for simulations and analysis of this model are very similar to the code here, just with additional parameters and the functions changed. Some optimisations made during ray tracing are also specific to the axisymmetric model, so are not present in the alternative model.

## 🖥️ Requirements 🖥️
The Fortran code utilises the following libraries:
- HEALPix
- OpenMP

NumPy is also required for f2py, which interfaces between the Fortran code and the Python code.


The Python code utilises the following libraries:
- Numpy
- SciPy
- emcee
- corner
- matplotlib
